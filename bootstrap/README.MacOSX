* system tools issues

** gcc vs clang

Older versions of Mac OS X (with XCode, of course) provided gcc, and
pkgsrc defaulted to using gcc.  With 10.9, gcc is no longer present.
(In 2014Q2 and earlier, one must explicitly bootstrap with
"--compiler=clang".)

** i386 vs x86_64 ABI issue

Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) through Mavericks (10.9) supports 64-bit
binaries on most Intel Macs and build those by default on such
machine.  This has caused problems with packages which get confused
because "MACHINE_ARCH" is in some OS versions set to "i386" (on a
64-bit system!).
  version:  uname -m : uname -p
  10.6: i386 : i386
  10.9: x86_64 : i386

There are of course some packages which will fail in i386 mode, and
some in x86_64 mode.  Because of all this, the default for pkgsrc was
set to use the 32-bit ABI, which results in packages being compiled
and run in i386 mode.  In addition, there are some Intel Macs (older
Mac Minis) which can only run i386 and not x86_64.  For a longer
discussion, see:
http://mail-index.NetBSD.org/pkgsrc-users/2009/09/24/msg010817.html

As of 2014, the decision to default to i386 should probably be
revisited.

** sed in 10.9

The sed that comes with 10.9 appears to be broken; it exits when
called on files with UTF-8 or other apparently-binary content.
Therefore, pkgsrc uses nbsed on 10.9.

* Developer tools and prerequisites

** basic tools

If you haven't already, you will need to install the Mac OS X
Developer Tools package (XCode) to obtain a compiler, etc.  The
procedure depends on the version of Mac OS X; recent versions use the
App Store.

Note that as of 10.9, cvs is no longer provided.  You can build
devel/scmcvs.  To obtain pkgsrc in order to bootstrap and build cvs,
it may be useful to `git clone https://github.com/jsonn/pkgsrc.git`.

** X11

X11 used to be built into Mac OS X, but as of 10.8 it is not.
Install XQuartz from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/

** XL compiler

[The text in this section dates from 2004-10-07!  Please update it if
you have used XL since then.]

Experimental support for IBM's XL C/C++ compiler is present (tested
with version 6.0). To use it, set:

PKGSRC_COMPILER=xlc

in mk.conf. XL C uses the Apple provided libtool to create shared
libraries, however, we must force it to call libtool with the full
path to avoid calling the pkgsrc provided GNU libtool with arguments
that it does not understand.

edit the template configuration file /opt/ibmcmp/vac/6.0/etc/vac.base.cfg
and set:

libtool = /usr/bin/libtool

then run:

/opt/ibmcmp/vacpp/6.0/bin/vacpp_configure -gcc /usr -install -force

as root to install the configuration.

to bootstrap with xlc, you need to make sure CFLAGS contains "-ma":

env CC=/opt/ibmcmp/vacpp/6.0/bin/xlc CFLAGS=-ma ./bootstrap

* Mac OS X Versions

pkgsrc is a volunteer project, and individuals support/fix packages
and platforms as they choose.  However, pkgsrc contributors as a group
share both a bugtracker and norms about what is ok to break and what
is not.  To describe these norms, we define levels of concern, keeping
in mind that there are no guarantees:

  SUPPORTED doesn't mean that anyone is required to fix your problem; it
  means that we agree that it is broadly desireable that such problems
  be fixed and that we therefore allow them to be listed in our issue
  tracker.

  DEPRECATED means that individual problems are not of interest, but
  pkgsrc overall working is of enough interest to be allowed to be
  listed in the issue tracker.

  IGNORED means we are not willing to expend issue tracker resources
  (clutter for those reviewing the db) at all.

Given the above definitions, the pkgsrc developers label versions of
Mac OS X as follows:

  10.9 (13.1.0): current, PRs may be filed.  Structurally breaking
	pkgsrc on 10.9 is considered not ok.  [SUPPORTED]

  10.8: somewhat old, PRs may still be filed.  Structurally breaking
	pkgsrc on 10.8 is considered not ok.  [SUPPORTED]

  10.7: old, but PRs may still be filed.  Structurally breaking pkgsrc
	on 10.7 is considered not ok. [SUPPORTED]

  10.6 (10.8.0): very old, and individual pkg PRs may be bounced to
	authors to retest with newer versions, and closed if that
	doesn't happen in 14 days.  We will for now consider
	structurally breaking pkgsrc on 10.6 to be undesirable.  If
	keeping support for 10.6 causes excessive work for maintainers
	it may be moved to IGNORED state any time, without
	warning. [DEPRECATED]

  10.5 and below: ancient, and PRs will be summarily closed.  It is
	acceptable to give zero consideration to causing structural
	problems on 10.5 and below. [IGNORED]

Because Apple provides 10.9 as a no-cost upgrade (from 10.6 or higher,
it is fairly likely that 10.6-10.8 will become DEPRECATED faster than
they might have otherwise.  (The rationale for supporting versions
beyond the current and previous ones has been the difficulty for users
to upgrade.)

* Bulk build suggestions and issues

Clearly, it is desirable for a bulk build to be useful on as many
computers as possible.  The main issues are which ABI and which OS X
version.

** 10.6, --abi=32

jperkin@netbsd.org provides a bulk build for quarterly branches
(--abi=32, OSX 10.6, and therefore gcc 4.2.1, XQuartz,
X11_TYPE=native):
  http://www.perkin.org.uk/pages/pkgsrc-binary-packages-for-osx.html
  http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-bulk/2014/01/10/msg010276.html
which should run on any version from 10.6 to 10.9.

Note that sed on 10.9 is broken, but a bootstrap on 10.6 will not
avoid it, so while one can install this bootstrap on 10.9 and run
binary packages, building packages will not in general work.

** 10.9, --abi=64 --compiler=clang

Given the 10.9 license situation, a bulk build on 10.9 (and therefore
clang) seems reasonable, with either --abi=32 or --abi=64.  Such
builds are almost certainly only usable on 10.9, but that is or will
be soon a large fraction of Macs.
